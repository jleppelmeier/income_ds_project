# income_ds_project
Classification and Clustering studies with an income-prediction dataset.


The goal in part 1 of this exercise was to classify instances of a dataset as having income <=50K or >50K. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine Classification techniques were used. The discussion of the classifiers and results is in the notebook: `income_classifier.ipynb`.

The goal in part 2 of this exercise was to segment the dataset and visualize interesting information about the clustering. The K-means Clustering algorithm was used. The discussion of the clustering and visualization is in the notebook: `income_segmentation.ipynb`.
